# 16-bit-RISC-Processor-Architecture
During university, I designed a custom 16-bit RISC processor architecture from scratch, which later served as the foundation for a comprehensive simulation project. The architecture supported a basic instruction set and demonstrated core processor functionalities such as instruction fetching, decoding, execution, and control flow. The project involved designing ALU operations, register files, control units, and data paths. I collaborated with teammates to write a simulation code that emulated the processorâ€™s internal behavior. This project sharpened my understanding of low-level computation and digital systems.
